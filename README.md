# Generative Agent Sim

This project is an implementation of the concepts from the paper "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" (Park et al., 2023) in Pygame.

## Introduction

This project aims to create generative agents—computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. The architecture behind these generative agents extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior.

## Dependencies

* Python 3.8 or higher
* Pygame 2.0.1 or higher
